# Outdoor Mobile Robotic Platform

This robot is basically an outdoor mobile assistant which was designed to navigate within a Patrol Zone autonomously or manually via an electronic device. 


## Description
All the sensors and motors are integrated using an Arduino UNO. Arduino UNO is based on ATmega328 microcontroller and contains 14 digital I/O, 6 analog inputs, 32KB flash memory, 2KB SRAM, 1KB EEPROM and performs at 16MHz clock speed. It has two Vcc ports which provides 5V at 100mA and 3.3v at 50mA. The Arduino itself is connected to a 12V lithium polymer battery which is regulated to supply 5V to the Arduino. Arduino IDE 1.6.9 was used to write and burn the code, C++ language, onto the board.

## Modules
It is able to establish a communication link with a computer or a smart phone via Bluetooth. 
The Arduino UNO was used with IR Sensors, USSR Sensor and PIR Sensor. These sensors were responsible for detecting collision and staying within the bounded region.

## Getting Started
The items required for this project are listed in the report file. Circuit schematics are in the image folder. Follow the input numbers in the source code to make the connections and compile and burn the code into the Arduino.
